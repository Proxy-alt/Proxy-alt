## ðŸ“š Featured Projects

### **Heavy Chromebook experimentation**
- A personal project to push my enterprise Chromebook to its limits by:
    - Attempting to change kervner versions (kernel versions) without unenrolling using [KVS](https://github.com/kxtzownsu/KVS/)
    - Attempting to unenroll my Chromebook via various methods
    - See how much I can tamper with my Chromebook while using [Shimboot](https://github.com/ading2210/shimboot)
    - When get permission potentially remove the write protect screw
- **TL;DR** just experimenting with my Chromebook a lot via various methods

### **PeteZah Docs**
- Documentation to utilize PeteZah and its services
- Allows others to make their own website simillar to PeteZah
- Gives instructions on how to make your own PeteZah website

### **General Exploit Research**
- This is for mainly getting around extensions such as Blocksi and Lightspeed
- Also to get around certain [Chrome Policys](chrome://policy) and unlock functionality out of your Chromebook
- Workarounds to obtain full capability out of your locked down Chromebook
